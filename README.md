# CG Lab Project

Submission template for the CG lab project at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.

### Explanation

This `README.md` needs to be pushed to Github for each of the 3 delivery dates.
For every submission change/extend the corresponding sections by replacing the *TODO* markers. Make sure that you push everything to your Github repository before the respective deadlines. For more details, see the Moodle page.

## Intermediate Submission due on 29.04.2023

Prepare a first version of your movie that:
 * is 30 seconds long,
 * contains animated objects, and
 * has an animated camera movement. 

Push your code on the day of the submission deadline. 
The repository needs to contain:
  * code/ Intermediate code + resources + libs
  * video/ A screen recording of the intermediate result

Nothing to change here in `README` file.

**Note:** You don’t need to use any lighting, materials, or textures yet. This will be discussed in later labs and can be added to the project afterwards!

## Final Submission due on 20.06.2023

The repository needs to contain:
  * code/ Documented code + resources + libs
  * video/ A screen recording of the movie
  * README.md


### Workload

| Student ID     | Workload (in %) |
| ---------------|-----------------|
| TODO           | TODO            |
| TODO           | TODO            |

Workload has to sum up to 100%.

### Effects

Select which effects you have implemented in the table below. Replace yes/no/partial with one of the options.
Mention in the comments column of the table where you have implemented the code and where it is visible (e.g., spotlight is the lamp post shining on the street). 

| Implemented    | ID | Name                                                                                                   | Max. Points | Issues/Comments |

### Special Effect Description

TODO

Describe how the effects work in principle and how you implemented them. If your effect does not work but you tried to implement it, make sure that you explain this. Even if your code is broken do not delete it (e.g., keep it as a comment). If you describe the effect (how it works, and how to implement it in theory), then you will also get some points. If you remove the code and do not explain it in the README this will lead to 0 points for the effect and the integration SE.

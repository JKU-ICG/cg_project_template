# Intermediate submission (due 28.04.2019)
Prepare a first version of your movie that:
- is 30 seconds long,
- has 3 scenes with objects, animations, and camera movement, and
- runs on the pool computers. 
We will inspect your intermediate movie in the 5th LAB (29th April to 3rd May), so make sure it is opened in the browser and runs when the lecturers/tutors looks at your project.
*Note: You donâ€™t need to use any lighting, materials, or textures yet. This will be discussed in later labs and should be added to the project afterwards!*
